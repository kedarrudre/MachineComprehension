John thought about things that John liked to do. Well , for one , John liked baseball. Compared to John friends , John was very good at the sport. John did n't even have to practice his friends much. John remembered that John once hit the ball so hard that the ball flew out of the park. Home run! John was also John. John enjoyed watching people on television pull off crazy tricks like slam dunking ( but John did n't really like all of the passes ). John was n't quite that good yet , but John was pretty good at making shots from the three point line. John knew that if John kept practicing , John would be really great someday. Finally , John loved football. Unlike baseball and basketball , John did n't play football John , but John was drawn to the games. John got a kick out of sitting in the stands , cheering on John team and friends. John once cheered so loud that John could barely speak at all for the rest of the day.
