Magneson walked over to the tree. Nancy flew up into the tree. Nancy wanted to warn Magneson about the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree. A few years before , the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree had thrown a chestnut at George and Nancy son. George was knocked out , and the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree took George away. George was never seen again. that Magneson asked Nancy 's son 's son their son 's name was. George and Nancy 's son said that Magneson was Leonard. But that Magneson was only making small talk. Leonard did n't believe the story about the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree. Even if there was one , there were many rocks by a pond that Leonard could throw at the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree. Leonard could also hide in the tall grass. George and Nancy 's son were sorry to see that Magneson would n't listen. George and Nancy 's son flew away , singing a sad song. A short time later , the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree came out of the tree and threw a giant walnut at that Magneson. No one ever saw Magneson again.
