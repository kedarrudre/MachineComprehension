In a quiet house there was a dog named Bentley. Bentley was a little brown puppy and Bentley was always getting into trouble. One day Bentley got outside and walked down the street. Bentley found a trash can and started to dig through a trash. A cat came also to see what Bentley was doing. `` Excuse A cat , but what are you looking for ? '' asked A cat. `` Well , nothing important , '' Bentley told A cat. `` Bentley wanted to see if there was anything cool in there . '' A cat told Bentley that A cat name was Felix and asked A cat he could dig through a trash too. `` Sure thing '' Bentley told A cat. The two of them started to dig through a trash again. After a little bit the pair got bored and started to walk down the street going away from Bentley house. They walked to a river and went to the edge of the water.

When They were clean They went back to Bentley 's house Inside Bentley 's They they got water on everything They they were still wet.
