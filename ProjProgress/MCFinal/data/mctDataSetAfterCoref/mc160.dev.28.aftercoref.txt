Once upon a time , there was a dog named Puddles. Puddles was lonely because Puddles lived in an area where there were no other dogs , but only The cats. Day after Day , Puddles would have to eat cat food and do cat things in order to fit in with the rest of Puddles group. Puddles found Day very boring and Puddles was sad. Puddles did n't even look like a cat! All of the other cats teased Puddles. `` You 're too big , '' they said. `` You 've got too long of a nose ! '' `` Why are they panting like they ? '' Puddles knew that Puddles was different. One day , Puddles chose to run away from all of the cats. The cats laughed at Puddles. What a stupid dog! Did n't a stupid dog him ? a stupid dog Puddles did n't care , because Puddles was sad enough to try. So Puddles packed up cat things - Puddles squeaky ball , Puddles water dish , and Puddles bone - and headed off into the woods that could eat. Puddles was finally happy! All of a sudden , Puddles turned. Puddles smelled a funny smell. a funny smell smelled like something Puddles had never smelled before. Puddles turned around , and what did Puddles see but another dog! Puddles was so happy , Puddles barked with joy. Puddles went home with the other dog , who was named Mittens , and to Puddles family. Puddles was never lonely again.
