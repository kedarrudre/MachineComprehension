Peter was a very sad puppy. Peter had been inside of the pet store for a very long time. In fact , Peter had been there for three months! Peter had seen many other puppies find a person ; Peter began to wonder why Peter could not get one. Peter thought that maybe Peter fur was not pretty enough or maybe Peter bark was not loud enough. Peter tried and tried to please every person who came to the pet store , but they all picked smaller puppies. However , one day all of this changed. Sammie came into the store looking for a golden puppy. Sammie wanted a puppy Sammie could snuggle with. a puppy she could snuggle with so happened that Peter was very sad and tired one day all of this. Sammie came to hold Peter. Peter wanted to show off his bark , but Peter was too tired. Peter fell right to sleep. Sammie loved Peter at once and loved holding Peter in Sammie arms. Sammie took Peter home that one day all of this , and they made lots of fun memories.
