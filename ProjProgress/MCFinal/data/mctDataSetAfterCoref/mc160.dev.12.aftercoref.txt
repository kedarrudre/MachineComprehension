When Cowboy was happy , which was not very often , Cowboy liked to bite in to a blanket or soft toy and carry a blanket around in Cowboy mouth. When Cowboy was hungry Cowboy liked to bite bright red tomatoes and suck out all the juice and seeds. And when Cowboy was feeling mean Cowboy liked to hide. Cowboy would hide , curled up tight in a ball under a blanket or behind a corner and wait for one of the little kids to pass by. When they did pass by Cowboy would jump at they feet and try to bite and scratch they. Cowboy did not know that what Cowboy was doing was not very nice. Cowboy was only a cat.
