It was the day. I was working outside in I garden. I was pulling weeds which is not I favorite job , but I was enjoying the day. I live by a lake so sometimes I take a break from I chores and look at a lake. a lake is so beautiful a lake it makes I happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in a lake the lake. On the day , I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from a lake. I got up from my garden and walked to a lake. I kept hearing this strange sound. this strange sound sounded like someone talking in a very low voice. I thought this strange sound this strange sound lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what them want to `` say '' to other lake birds. There is the call when them are flying which is very hurried and short. Then there is the `` where are them . the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short But this strange sound was not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything. But , no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally given up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was this strange sound coming from? I looked again up and down a lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep we boats. There is a very deep part a very deep part of the water the water there where it is not a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! a very a very deep part of the water water was a mother lake bird and them father lake bird with a baby in between them. them were teaching a baby how to swim and eat fish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. I felt very special that I got to see this. this was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening.
