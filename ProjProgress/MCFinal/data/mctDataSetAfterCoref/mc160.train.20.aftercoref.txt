Mary and Buddy both liked to play games like fetch and hide and seek. Neither of Mary and Buddy liked to take a bath. Mary and Buddy enjoyed smelling flowers and eating hamburgers. But Mary and Buddy also were very different from one another. For one thing , Buddy was Buddy! Buddy liked talking to strangers and visiting new places. But Mary was shy. One day a man named John came by. Mary hid behind a tree when Mary saw a man named John. Buddy tried to tell Mary a tree was okay , but Mary was too scared to listen. So Buddy went out to say hello to John. John was very nice and John liked the same games as Buddy. Mary watched Buddy chase after a ball John threw. Mary could tell John was John. Mary wanted to play too. Buddy saw Mary watching and led Buddy new friend over to Mary. John waved to Mary and brought Mary a flower. Mary smiled at John. Mary thought John was very kind and Mary was n't as nervous as before. Buddy barked happily. Yay for new friends!
