a good dog was playing in the street outside. I walked past a good dog and threw the ball a good dog him. a good dog seemed to be hot from the heat of the day. I then headed to the store because I needed to buy some food and other things that were needed. I entered the store and said hi to Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones had been working at the store for a long time. I walked to the back of the store and picked up some cold sodas and a bottle of orange juice. I then went and picked up some popcorn. This would be good for eating later while watching tv. I then went to the dog food section and picked a meat treat for a good dog. I then went up to the front of the store and paid Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones smiled and thanked I for shopping Mr. Jones the store. Then I walked back to I house and looked at a good dog. a good dog name was Rex and had lived with us for around four years. a good dog coat was brown and white. I unwrapped the dog treat and gave the dog treat to a good dog. Rex seemed happy and started to lick I hand in happiness. a good dog was a good my hand and I made me feel a good dog that he was happy.
