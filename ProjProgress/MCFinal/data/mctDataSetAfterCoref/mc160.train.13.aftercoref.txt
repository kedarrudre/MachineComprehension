Flying a kite can be dangerous. When I was eight years old I went to the park with I dad to fly I new kite. We stood on the top of a hill and tried to catch the wind. the top of a hill took We almost half an hour , but We finally got my new kite into the air. As the top of a hill lifted into the sky , my new kite caught the edge of I jacket and I was pulled up into the wind my new kite kite. I flew higher and higher into the air until I my dad to fly my new kite looked like an ant on the ground. the park was beautiful from up high , and I could see We car getting smaller. I flew all the way out of the city and over the lake. Eventually , the wind started to die down and I fell closer to the water. I called out to some people on a boat and some people sailed over so I could land a boat their boat. I told some people about I adventure some people they sailed I back to land , where my dad to fly my new kite picked I up. my dad to fly my new kite took I out for ice cream and we went home.
