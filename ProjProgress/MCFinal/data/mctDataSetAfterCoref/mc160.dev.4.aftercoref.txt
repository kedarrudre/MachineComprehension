Kelly , Kelly Kelly said that it was that time of year to take This year family vacation. We 've been to big ride parks that have hotels with large pools. This year My wanted to do something different. Kelly wanted to take We all to Elk River Castle. After lots of planning We hit the road for We trip. My Brother Kelsey and My enjoyed the long car ride there. Once We arrive , Elk River Castle looked much bigger than We had imagined. There was so much to see and so much to do. There was a swimming pool , movie theater and an elevator to take We from floor to floor. What a magical place! My was so excited because We had the whole place to We family! We spent We family vacation playing around the huge castle and finding small mysterious places. There was even a tiny room in the back of one of the closets. My brother , Kelsey , and My played hide and go seek for hours , watched movies and swam until the sun went down. It was sad when We family vacation finally came to an end We we made some amazing memories. We 'll never forget our trip to Elk River Castle!
